    <h2>Lesson 8: Web Portal Creation.</h2>
    <p>People use HTML codes to create pages and CSS codes to design them. If you have taken up these coding skills before, it will help you in creating pages using WYSIWYG. If you have not, WYSIWYG is designed for everyone who has not or does not have prior coding skills.</p>
    <p>WYSIWYG is the acronym for What You See Is What You Get. This means that whatever you type, insert, draw, place, rearrange, and everything you do on a page is what the audience will see.</p>
    <p>So in summary, Lesson 8 is about how we can make a simple or basic web portal creation! Quite fun, isn't it?</p>

    <h2>Lesson 9: Collaborative ICT Development</h2>
    <p>A web portal is a website that contains information from different sources and places them in one location in a uniform way.</p>
    <p>Online Collaborative Tools</p>
    <p>Working together does not necessarily mean you have to be physically together. These tools can help your group “go the distance” and work as if you already have your own office.</p>
    <p>An example of a web portal is Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com). Yahoo.com offers a web portal where news, email, weather, etc., are found on one page.</p>
    <p>1. You can use Facebook groups to create a group page that will allow people in your group to communicate your ideas.</p>
    <p>2. WordPress also allows you to have multiple contributors for a single blog.</p>
    <p>3. Google Drive and Microsoft Office Online allow multiple people to work on different office files and even have their own group’s cloud storage.</p>
    <p>4. Microsoft’s Yammer offers companies their own social network that allows sharing and managing content.</p>
    <p>5. Sites like Trello offer an online to-do checklist for your entire team.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using tools like Google Docs for real-time collaboration.</li>
      <li>Project management with Trello.</li>
      <li>Version control with GitHub.</li>
    </ul>
